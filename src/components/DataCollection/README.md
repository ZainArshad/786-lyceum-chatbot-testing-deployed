## DataCollection

This folder contains the forms at the molecular level. The forms are used to collect data from the user.
All the basic resuseable forms should go in this folder. For example, use the components from material ui and custom form components from `src/components/Forms` and create fully funancial responsive form in this folder so that they are useable throughout the application.

These forms should validate data and communicate with the backend to store or update data.
